    512 bytes of padding to suppress Internet Explorer's "Friendly error messages"

    From: HOW TO: Turn Off the Internet Explorer 5.x and 6.x "Show Friendly HTTP Error Messages" Feature on the Server Side
          http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294807

    Several frequently-seen status codes have "friendly" error messages 
    that Internet Explorer 5.x displays and that effectively mask the 
    actual text message that the server sends.
    However, these \"friendly\" error messages are only displayed if the 
    response that is sent to the client is less than or equal to a 
    specified threshold.
    For example, to see the exact text of an HTTP 500 response, 
    the content length must be greater than 512 bytes.
